## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package,npm,
installed in your environement. You can equally use yarn as your package manager

### Node

-   #### Node installation on Windows

    Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the
    installer. Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might
    need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

-   #### Node installation on Ubuntu

    You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the
    following commands.

        $ sudo apt install nodejs
        $ sudo apt install npm

-   #### Other Operating Systems
    You can find more information about the installation on the
    [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the
    [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following
command.

    $ node --version
    v12.6.0  or above

    $ npm --version
    6.13.4 or above

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After
running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
